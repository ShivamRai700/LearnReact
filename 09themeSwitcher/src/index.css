@import "tailwindcss";
@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));

/* if you want your dark theme to be driven by a CSS selector instead of the prefers-color-scheme media query, override the dark variant to use your custom selector:

app.css
@import "tailwindcss";
@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));

Now instead of dark:* utilities being applied based on prefers-color-scheme, they will be applied whenever the dark class is present earlier in the HTML tree: 

<html class="dark">
  <body>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
